Trained dHBV models are kept here.

Two versions currently exist:
1) hydrofabric_15 is trained on 15 years of AORC forcings using hydrofabric-sourced static catchment attributes.
2) merit_15 is trained on 15 years of GAGES-II forcings using merit unit basins and associated static catchment attributes.

Both can be downloaded from S3.
